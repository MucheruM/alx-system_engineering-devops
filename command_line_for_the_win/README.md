#CMD Challenge - Command Line for the Win

##Overview
This project is a CMD Challenge designed to enhance Bash skills
through a series of command line challenges. Completing any part of this project
is optional, but it comes with a bonus project grade of over 100% if accomplished.

##Background Context
CMD CHALLENGE is a game focusing on command line tasks, with questions
gradually increasing in complexity. It serves as excellent training to improve
your command line skills. Remember, this project is 100% optional, and your
overall score won't be affected if you choose not to participate.
However, if your current average is greater than your score on this project,
your average might go down.

##Requirements
###General
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Manual QA review will be conducted after the project is completed.
As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green.
Create a screenshot for each completed level, demonstrating your success.
Push the screenshots to GitHub in either PNG or JPEG format.

###Specific
Demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line
tool to move local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

###Steps for SFTP File Transfer
Take screenshots of completed levels in the
directory /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/.
Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Use the SFTP command-line tool to connect to the sandbox environment
(hostname, username, and password will be provided).
Navigate to the desired directory in the sandbox environment where you want to
upload the screenshots.
Use the SFTP put command to transfer the screenshots from your local machine
to the sandbox environment.
Confirm the successful transfer by checking the sandbox directory.
After the screenshots are transferred, proceed to push them to GitHub, following
the initial requirements.
Include a detailed explanation of the steps used for SFTP file transfer in the
project's README.md file.
